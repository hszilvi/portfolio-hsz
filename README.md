# Overview
This is the solution of the 2nd week challange. In this challange I had to make at least 10 commits to github, recreate the portfolio website from scratch.

## My_process
I recreated the layout was given, added responsivity. Started mobile view first. 
I used HTML, CSS to make the website work and meet all the layout criterias. And learned how to apply flexbox and grid and how to use media queries.
I used gitBash to commit all the changes I made on the project using git add . / git commit -m '' / and git push commands. 
I wrote the readme.md with the relative path to screen shot and links and other expected contents. 

### Built_with
HTML, CSS, VS code
For checking my code I used HTML validator (W3School) and my browser extension for accessability evaluation. 

## What_I_learned
After this practise I became confident in using git Bash and better understand HTML tags and CSS. I understood how flexbox and grids work.

### Continued_developement
- I still need to learn more about SEO aspects,
- need to start using git branches to improve my github knowledge, 
- need to practise more CSS,
- use media queries.
